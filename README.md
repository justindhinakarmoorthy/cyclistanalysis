Data Cleaning Process : 

The Data consisted of a 13 Columns and approximately 50,000 rows per month. Considering the large amount of data, I have used the " R" for Data prep and Cleaning process. 12 different excel files were merged into a single file. The merged file was checked for missing information and the rows with missing piece of information were deleted. Ride time was calculated using the start and end time of each rental transaction. Since Negative values were noted on the ride time, They were deleted as invalid rows. Tableau was used to visualize the data set and analysed.
